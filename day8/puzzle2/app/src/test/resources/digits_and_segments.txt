How to work out what letter each segment is?

top (a): 1 and 7 are known, difference is the top segment

facts:
- step#1: SEG top: 1 and 7 are known, and only differ in this one segment
- step#2: top left + middle: 1 and 4 are known, hence b+d are those segments
- step#3: bottom left + bottom: 4 segments and top segments are known, so from 8 we know e+g are these segments
- step#6: SEG middle: after identifying 0, 8 is known, and gives us the middle
- step#7: SEG top left: is known from (difference between middle and top left + middle)
- step#9: SEG bottom left: diff between 5 and 6 gives us bottom left = e
- step#10: SEG bottom: diff between (bottom left, bottom left + bottom) gives us bottom
- step#11: SEG top right: diff between 6 and 8, gives us top right
- step#12: SEG bottom right: diff between (top right and 1)

known digits:
- 1, 4, 7, 8

how to find remaining digits:
- step#4: 6: only other digit with 6 segments and top left + middle and bottom left + bottom
- step#5: 0: the 6 segment digit with bottom left + bottom (apart from the 6)
- step#8: 5: the only 5 segment with top left and middle
